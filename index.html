            <h2>Why?</h2>
            <p>
                Alzheimer's is a type of dementia that affects memory, thinking,
                and behavior and accounts for 60-80% of dementia cases.
                Alzheimer's is a progressive disease, where symptoms gradually
                worsen over a number of years until individuals lose the ability
                to carry on a conversation and respond to their environment.

            <p>
                Nearly 7 million Americans are currently living with Alzheimer’s
                and approximately 33% of seniors die with Alzheimer’s or another
                form of Dementia.
            </p>

            <p>
                Unfortunately, I am all too familiar with just how devastating
                this disease can be. My father was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in
                2015, and passed away in 2022.

            <p>
                That is why, for my birthday, there would be no greater gift you
                could give me than joining me in making a donation to help lead
                the fight against Alzheimer’s Disease.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Alzheimer's Association leads the way to end Alzheimer's and
                all other dementia — by accelerating global research, driving
                risk reduction and early detection, and maximizing quality care
                and support.
